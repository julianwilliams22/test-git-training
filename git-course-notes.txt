git fetch
git diff origin/main


after creating repo
default branch is usually 'master'
however on github it is 'main'

each commit results in the brajch being changed to point to the new commit object

master is just like any other branch

git checkout changes which branch HEAD points to
HEAD is pointer to a pointer
HEAD is pointer to active branch

Checkout of earlier commit object will cause a 'detached head'
HEAD no longer points to a branch
With a detached HEAD, any further commits will affetcively create a new branch whihc can't be referenced
